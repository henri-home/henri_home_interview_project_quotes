# App description and requirements

* Ron Swanson Challenge Using the 'Ron Swanson Quotes API' - https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes#ron-swanson-quotes-api

* As an internet user I should be able to get a random Ron Swanson quote on demand. It should allow me to click a button/image to get a Swanson word of wisdom.

* As an internet user I should be able to rate a Ron Swanson Quote. It should let me give it rating of 1 to 5 on a quote. It should not let the same IP address rate more than 1 time.

* As an internet user I should be able to see the average rating for a Ron Swanson Quote. It should show me the average rating for a quote when displaying the quote.

# Tech stack requirements

* Import a CSS Framework - Use default components as style/design is not a requirement

* Create ruby classes/service objects to handle the API call(s) and the received data. We use SimpleCommand https://github.com/nebulab/simple_command and HTTParty https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty although feel free to use something else.

* Convert the data into a ruby object before displaying/storing data.

* Use some AJAX/Javascript for coding example purposes.

* RSPEC tests for model and API methods used.
